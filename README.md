This repository contains solutions for TW101 Exercises and Introductory Programming Assignments from July 2015. 

Exercise #1: Print all odd numbers from 1 to 100 and their sum.

Exercise #2: Create a class that counts how many times you call the method increment() and prints out that number when you call total(). Create a main method that calls increment() 5 times and then calls total().

Exercise #3: Create a function of in the class OddSum that returns the sum of all odd integers between a starting and ending integer value.

Exercise #4: Create a class Library with a method PrintBooksContaining(String partialBookName) that prints out all of the books in the Library whose title contains the string passed in. You should pass an array of book titles into the Library constructor.

Exercise #5: Create an array of 5 Rectangles (each with height and width instance variables and an area() method). Find the average area of the rectangles.

Exercise #6: Create Orc and Troll classes that implement a Monster interface with takeDamage(int amount), String name(), and int currentHitpoints() methods. Store instances of both classes and store them in an ArrayList. Iterate through the list and make each monster take 10 points of damage. After you have damaged all of the monsters, report the name and current hit points of all monsters.
  Orcs are named “Orc” and have 20 initial hitpoints
  Trolls are named “Troll”, have 40 hit points and only take half damage

Exercise #7: Write a program that chooses a random number between 1 and 100. Then asks the user to enter a guess. If they guess right then tell them they win, otherwise tell them if they guessed too high or low. Keep asking the user to guess until they get the right answer. Use classes to separate the different concerns of this program. Integer.parseInt is a good way to convert user input into an Integer.

Exercise #8: Create a new version of Exercise #7 where you also record all of the user’s guesses and print them out once they guess correctly. Use an ArrayList to store the guesses. Catch the NumberFormatException and handle the case where the user entered a String that is not parseable.

Exercise #9: Create a class Node that implements a binary tree for Strings. It should have an add(String name) method that recursively finds the correct place to add a new node and a names() method that returns the names of all of the nodes in alphabetical order (this should also be implemented using recursion).
